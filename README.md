# cms-with-nodejs

This project is used to simulate a CMS. Think of Joomla or wordpres. Users of this project will be able to add users and their permissions as well as creating websites easily and effectively. I want this CMS system to be able to spawn its own server as well as allow to deploy to a different webserver.

What do I want to see in this application:
- Administration page
- Website (option to have multiple websites...more like joomla)
- Ability to use any database connection (mysql will be first...then implement other databases)
- Ability to use themes.
- etc.
